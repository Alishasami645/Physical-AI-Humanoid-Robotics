# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – Specification

Feature: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics  
Focus: AI Systems in the Physical World, Embodied Intelligence  
Goal: Bridge the gap between digital brain and physical body. Students apply AI knowledge to control humanoid robots in simulation and real environments.

Modules & Chapters:
1. **Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**
   - ROS 2 architecture
   - Nodes, Topics, Services
   - Python agents & URDF
2. **Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**
   - Physics simulation
   - Robot/environment modeling
   - Sensor simulation: LiDAR, IMUs, Depth Cameras
3. **AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**
   - Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS
   - Path planning & navigation
   - Reinforcement learning
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**
   - LLM integration
   - Voice-to-Action commands
   - Cognitive planning

Learning Outcomes:
- Understand Physical AI principles
- Master ROS 2 for robot control
- Simulate robots in Gazebo & Unity
- Develop with NVIDIA Isaac
- Integrate GPT/LLMs for conversational robotics
- Design humanoid robots for natural interaction

Hardware Requirements:
- Workstations: NVIDIA RTX GPU, Ubuntu 22.04, 64GB RAM
- Edge AI kits: Jetson Orin Nano, RealSense Camera, ReSpeaker USB Mic
- Optional: Unitree Go2/G1 humanoid robot

Capstone Project:
- Autonomous humanoid robot receives voice commands, navigates obstacles, identifies objects, manipulates them, and reports actions.

Notes:
- Ensure Docusaurus Markdown compatibility.
- Lessons, chapters, diagrams, and UI elements should follow Docusaurus structure.
- Save history prompts for all generated content in: `history/prompts/feature/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/`.
