# Research Notes – Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Feature: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics  
Objective: Document all research, references, and rationale for the course design, modules, and capstone project.

## 1. Research Focus Areas

### a) Physical AI Principles
- Embodied intelligence vs. digital-only AI
- Human-robot interaction
- Sensor fusion and multi-modal perception

### b) ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)
- Nodes, topics, services, actions
- Python integration with ROS controllers
- URDF for humanoid robots
- ROS 2 middleware and communication

### c) Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Physics-based robot simulation
- Collision, gravity, and environment modeling
- Sensor simulation: LiDAR, IMUs, RGB-D cameras
- Unity for high-fidelity rendering

### d) AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- Isaac Sim: synthetic data generation & photorealistic simulation
- Isaac ROS for perception, navigation, and VSLAM
- Reinforcement learning for bipedal locomotion
- Sim-to-real transfer methods

### e) Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- LLM integration for robotics
- Voice-to-action translation (e.g., OpenAI Whisper)
- Cognitive planning: translating commands into ROS 2 sequences
- Multi-modal AI for perception and action

## 2. Capstone Project Research
- Autonomous humanoid receives voice commands
- Navigation and obstacle avoidance
- Object recognition and manipulation
- Reporting actions using conversational AI

## 3. Learning Outcomes Reference
- Align each module to intended learning outcomes
- Ensure assessment tasks reflect research findings

## 4. Hardware & Lab Requirements
- High-performance workstation (GPU, CPU, RAM, OS)
- Edge AI kits (Jetson Orin Nano, RealSense camera, ReSpeaker)
- Optional humanoid robots (Unitree Go2/G1)
- Cloud-based alternatives if hardware unavailable

## 5. References & Sources
- ROS 2 documentation (Humble/Iron)
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS
- Gazebo & Unity simulation guides
- AI for robotics literature
- OpenAI Whisper and LLM integration papers
