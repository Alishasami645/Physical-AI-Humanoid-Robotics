# Lesson 2.1: ROS 2 Architecture

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a framework for developing robot software. It provides modular architecture, communication infrastructure, and tools for building complex robotic systems.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Nodes:** Independent processing units that perform computation
- **Topics:** Publish/subscribe communication channels between nodes
- **Services:** Request/response interactions for synchronous tasks
- **Actions:** Long-running tasks with progress feedback
- **Middleware:** DDS (Data Distribution Service) for reliable communication
- **Package system:** Organize nodes, libraries, and configurations

**Examples:**
- Sensor node publishes camera images to a topic
- Motion control node subscribes to commands
- Service for resetting robot position
