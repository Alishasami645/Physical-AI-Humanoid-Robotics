# Lesson 6.1: Autonomous Humanoid Overview

The Capstone Project focuses on building an autonomous humanoid robot by integrating concepts from all previous chapters.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Autonomy:** Robot performs tasks without human intervention
- **Perception:** Uses sensors like cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs
- **Control:** Executes motion using ROS 2 and actuators
- **Decision-making:** Cognitive planning and task reasoning

**Example Workflow:**
1. Robot perceives environment through sensors.
2. Decision-making module determines next actions.
3. Motion and control modules execute physical movements.
4. Feedback loops adjust behavior in real-time.
