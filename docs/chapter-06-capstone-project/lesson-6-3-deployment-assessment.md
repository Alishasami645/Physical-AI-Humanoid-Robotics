# Lesson 6.3: Deployment & Assessment

Deployment involves testing the humanoid in real-world scenarios and evaluating performance.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Sim-to-real transfer:** Move algorithms from simulation to physical robot
- **Task assessment:** Evaluate success rate of autonomous actions
- **Safety checks:** Ensure robot operates without hazards
- **Performance metrics:** Speed, accuracy, stability, task completion

**Example Workflow:**
1. Deploy trained humanoid robot from simulation to real environment.
2. Run predefined tasks and monitor results.
3. Evaluate performance using metrics.
4. Iterate improvements and refine control algorithms.
