# Welcome to the Robotics Book

This book is designed to guide you through the exciting world of **robotics**, from basic concepts to advanced simulations and humanoid robot control. Throughout the chapters, you'll explore:

- **AI and Machine Learning in Robotics** – How intelligent algorithms control physical robots.  
- **Simulation Environments** – Using Gazebo, Unity, and other tools to create realistic virtual robots.  
- **Digital Twin Technology** – Understanding the virtual replica of real-world robots.  
- **Hands-on Projects** – Step-by-step tutorials to apply what you learn.  

By the end of this book, you will have the skills to bridge the gap between **software intelligence** and **physical robot systems**, building projects that interact with the real world.
