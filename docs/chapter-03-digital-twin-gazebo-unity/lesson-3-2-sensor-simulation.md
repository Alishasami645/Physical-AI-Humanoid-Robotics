# Lesson 3.2: Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Cameras, IMU)

Simulating sensors in Gazebo or Unity allows testing perception and control algorithms without a real robot.

**Key Sensors:**
- **LiDAR:** Measures distances and generates 3D point clouds
- **Cameras:** RGB or depth cameras for vision-based tasks
- **IMU:** Provides orientation, acceleration, and angular velocity

**Example Workflow:**
1. Attach LiDAR, camera, and IMU to the robot model.
2. Publish sensor data to ROS 2 topics.
3. Visualize sensor streams in RViz or Unity.
4. Test algorithms like SLAM, object detection, and navigation.
