# Lesson 3.3: High-Fidelity Rendering with Unity

High-fidelity rendering ensures robots and environments look realistic, which helps in visualization, debugging, and AI perception development.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Materials & Shaders:** Realistic surfaces
- **Lighting:** Directional, spot, and ambient lights
- **Camera setups:** Multiple views for robot sensors
- **Post-processing:** Effects like bloom, shadows, reflections
- **Integration with sensors:** Cameras and depth sensors mimic real-world perception

**Example Workflow:**
1. Apply realistic textures to robot and environment.
2. Add lighting for accurate shadows.
3. Use virtual cameras to simulate robot sensors.
4. Observe robot behavior with realistic visual feedback.
