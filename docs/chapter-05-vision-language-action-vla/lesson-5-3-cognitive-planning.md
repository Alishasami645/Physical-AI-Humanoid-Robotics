# Lesson 5.3: Cognitive Planning & Multi-modal Interaction

Cognitive planning allows robots to combine multiple sensory inputs and reasoning for complex task execution.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Multi-modal inputs:** Vision, audio, touch, and sensor data
- **Task decomposition:** Break complex commands into subtasks
- **Sequential planning:** Determine order of actions
- **Real-time adaptation:** Adjust plan based on sensor feedback
- **Integration with LLM and VLA:** Combine reasoning, language, and action

**Example Workflow:**
1. Robot receives a multi-step command.
2. Plan generated using LLM reasoning + sensor data.
3. Actions executed sequentially, adapting to environment changes.
4. Robot reports status and confirms task completion.
