# Lesson 5.1: LLM Integration

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into robots to enable understanding of natural language commands and reasoning.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Interpret human commands
- **Planning:** Convert commands into actionable tasks
- **Integration with ROS 2:** Publish tasks as topics/services
- **Safety & validation:** Ensure safe execution in real-world scenarios

**Example Workflow:**
1. User gives a command: "Pick up the red object and place it on the table."
2. LLM interprets the command into robot actions.
3. ROS 2 nodes execute the planned sequence.
4. Robot performs the task in simulation or real environment.
