# Lesson 1.1: What is Physical AI

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the real world through physical bodies, sensors, and actuators. Unlike traditional AI, which exists only as software, Physical AI combines cognition, perception, and action in a single system.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Embodiment:** AI integrated with a physical body
- **Sensors:** Cameras, LiDAR, IMUs for perceiving the environment
- **Actuators:** Motors, servos, robotic arms for interaction
- **Feedback loops:** Real-time sensing, planning, and acting
- **Learning & Adaptation:** Systems improve performance over time

**Why Physical AI is Important:**
- Traditional AI struggles in unstructured, dynamic environments.
- Physical AI enables robots to adapt, learn, and act in real-world scenarios.
- Applications include humanoid robots, autonomous drones, service robots, and mobile manipulators.

**Examples:**
- Humanoid robots like ASIMO and Atlas
- Factory robotic arms performing assembly
- Drones navigating complex environments
