# Lesson 1.2: Embodied Intelligence

Embodied Intelligence is the principle that intelligence emerges through interaction between a body and its environment. Physical AI leverages this by combining sensors, actuators, and AI algorithms in a feedback loop.

**Key Concepts:**
- Sensorimotor loops for perception-action coordination
- Adaptive behavior based on environmental feedback
- Body-environment coupling for robust intelligence
- Multimodal integration: vision, touch, motion

**Examples:**
- A humanoid robot learning to walk or manipulate objects
- Robotic arms adjusting grip based on tactile feedback
- Drones navigating through dynamic obstacles
