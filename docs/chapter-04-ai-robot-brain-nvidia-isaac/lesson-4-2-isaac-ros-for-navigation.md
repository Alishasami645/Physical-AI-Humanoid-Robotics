# Lesson 4.2: Isaac ROS for Navigation

Isaac ROS provides prebuilt ROS 2 packages and nodes for robot navigation, including path planning, mapping, and control.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Localization:** Determine robot’s position in a map
- **Mapping:** Create 2D/3D maps of the environment
- **Path Planning:** Plan collision-free paths
- **Motion Control:** Command velocity and joint positions
- **ROS 2 topics/services:** Publish/subscribe navigation data

**Example Workflow:**
1. Connect Isaac Sim robot to ROS 2 using Isaac ROS bridge.
2. Run localization and mapping nodes.
3. Plan paths to target points.
4. Control robot actuators to follow the path.
5. Monitor sensors and adjust navigation in real time.
