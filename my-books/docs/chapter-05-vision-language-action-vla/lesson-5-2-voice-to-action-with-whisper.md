# Lesson 5.2: Voice-to-Action with Whisper

Voice-to-Action allows robots to understand spoken commands using speech recognition models like Whisper.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Speech recognition:** Convert voice to text
- **Command parsing:** Interpret text into robot actions
- **ROS 2 integration:** Publish actions to control nodes
- **Multi-modal coordination:** Combine voice, vision, and sensor inputs

**Example Workflow:**
1. User says: "Move forward 2 meters."
2. Whisper converts speech to text.
3. Text is processed by the robot’s planning module.
4. Robot executes the action safely.
