# Lesson 3.1: Gazebo Simulation Basics

Gazebo is a powerful 3D robotics simulator that allows testing and development of robots in virtual environments before deploying to the real world.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Worlds:** Virtual environments where robots operate
- **Models:** Robots, objects, sensors, obstacles
- **Plugins:** Add behavior to robots and sensors
- **Physics engine:** Simulates realistic dynamics
- **ROS 2 integration:** Nodes interact with simulated robots

**Example Workflow:**
1. Load a Gazebo world.
2. Spawn a humanoid robot URDF/XACRO model.
3. Run ROS 2 nodes to control the robot.
4. Observe motion, sensor data, and interactions.
